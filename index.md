You have always wanted to learn the basics of programming? You like puzzles and want to control robots? No problem. In our course you will learn the core concepts of programming with Karel. 

The [Karel programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_(programming_language)) is a cool introduction to the world of programming and makes it much easier to get started in the world of Java, Python, C# and Co. We let the robot Karel wander through a labyrinth  and solve puzzles together.

What you need:
- curiosity, joy of learning, also from mistakes and you are at least 12 years old (12 to 99 years old)

Do not worry, we can always switch to German, Romanian or in Swahili. Our inspirers will take care of each of you.
