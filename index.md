## Children from all over the world meet and code together

You have always wanted to learn the basics of programming? 

You like puzzles and want to control robots? No problem. In our 
course you will learn the core concepts of programming with Karel. 

The Karel programming language is a cool introduction to the world of 
programming languages and makes it much easier to get started in the world of Java, Python, C# and Co. We let the robot Karel wander through a labyrinth  and solve puzzles together.

What you need:
- Curiosity, joy of learning, also from mistakes and you are at least 12 years old (12 to 99 years old)
- Computer and a stable internet connection
- School English skills - don't forget, programming languages are in English. 

Do not worry, we can always switch to German, Romanian or in Swahili. Our inspirers will take care of each of you.

Program:
- Get to know the programming environment: getting ready to code
- Introduction to the programming languages
- Do it and learn: Let robot Karel wander too far through labyrinth and puzzle together

Are you with us? We are looking forward to cool-coding with you.
